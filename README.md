# French Railway Signalling

This repository serves as a **backup** of the pages, Lua modules, and templates I authored for the [OpenRailwayMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Tagging_in_France), focusing on **French railway signalling**. It ensures long-term preservation of the documentation in case of unexpected deletions or unauthorized edits on the wiki platform.

## JOSM Presets

The repository also includes **JOSM presets** specifically designed for mapping French railway signalling. These presets are aligned with the latest version of the wiki documentation and are actively maintained to remain up to date.

## Download the Presets

‚¨áÔ∏è [French_Railway_Signalling_presets.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noeldev/FrenchRailwaySignalling/main/French_Railway_Signalling_presets.zip)

This archive contains the latest preset XML files along with the required icon assets (SVG and PNG).

## Notes

- All icons (SVG/PNG) are either original creations or adapted from files on Wikimedia Commons (with attribution where applicable), or from [Nicolas Wurtz's signalisation-rfn-svg project](https://github.com/nicolaswurtz/signalisation-rfn-svg).
- This project is a **work in progress**. Both the presets and the associated documentation are continuously improved. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

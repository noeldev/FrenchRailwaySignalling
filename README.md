# French Railway Signalling

This repository serves as a **backup** of the pages, Lua modules, and templates I authored for the [OpenRailwayMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Tagging_in_France), focusing on **French railway signalling**. It ensures long-term preservation of the documentation in case of unexpected deletions or inappropriate edits on the wiki platform.

## JOSM Presets

The repository also includes **JOSM presets** specifically designed for mapping French railway signalling. These presets are aligned with the current revision of the wiki documentation and are actively maintained to remain up to date.

### Installation

The recommended way to use the presets is to install them directly from within the [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) application:

1. Go to **Presets** ‚Üí **Presets Preferences** ‚Üí **Tagging Presets**.
2. Search for **French Railway Signalling** in the **Available Presets** search box.
3. Select the matching preset.
4. Click the right-pointing arrow to add it to **Active Presets**.
5. Click OK.

Alternatively, you can download and install the presets manually:

‚¨áÔ∏è [Download the ZIP archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noeldev/FrenchRailwaySignalling/main/French_Railway_Signalling_presets.zip)

This archive contains the latest preset XML files along with the required icon assets (SVG and PNG).

## Notes

- All icons (SVG/PNG) are either original creations or adaptations of files from Wikimedia Commons, or from [Nicolas Wurtz‚Äôs signalisation-rfn-svg project](https://github.com/nicolaswurtz/signalisation-rfn-svg).
- This project is a **work in progress**. Both the presets and the associated documentation are continuously improved.

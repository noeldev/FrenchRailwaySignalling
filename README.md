# French Railway Signalling

A set of templates and Lua modules that help document French railway signalling on the [OpenRailwayMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Tagging_in_France).

This repository serves as a backup of the pages authored on the OSM Wiki related to French railway tagging and signalling conventions. It ensures long-term preservation of the documentation and makes it easier to track changes over time.

## JOSM Presets

This repository also contains JOSM presets specifically tailored to French railway infrastructure. These presets are designed to reflect the current revision of the wiki and are continuously updated to remain in sync with it.

⚠️ **Work in progress** — presets and documentation are actively maintained and subject to improvement.

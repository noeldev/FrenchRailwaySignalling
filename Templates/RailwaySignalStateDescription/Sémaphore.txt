The train driver must stop before the signal. However:
* A closed semaphore can be passed without stopping during shunting operations, upon the order of the shunting supervisor.
* In automatic block signalling ([https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block%20automatique%20lumineux BAL] or [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_automatique_%C3%A0_permissivit%C3%A9_restreinte BAPR]), the driver of maintenance trains is permitted to pass closed semaphores without stopping, proceeding "en marche à vue" at a speed not exceeding 15 km/h.
